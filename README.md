# Description:
This is a simple blog project built with fullstack django.<br>
The main purpose is to practice django development and concepts.<br>
It's intended for a single author using the django admin portal.<br>
Additional users can be added by the admin.<br>
Everything is dynamically generated and inserted into django templates.<br>
All the user needs to do is login and write the article in /admin.<br>
A little bit of Bootstrap5 and custom CSS are used on the front-end.<br>

#### Project is built on:
Ubuntu 20.04<br>
Python 3.10.4<br>
Django 4.0.3<br>
##### Additional requirements:<br>
pip install pillow <i>(for handling images)</i><br>

__On a personal note__ I'd like to say the built-in django templates don't play very well<br>
with bootstrap and for some reason the VS Code linters reorder the code in a strange way<br>
and basically break it so I've written all the HTML, CSS and django templating language by hand.

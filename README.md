# Description:
This is a simple blog project built with django.<br>
The main purpose is to practice django development and concepts.<br>
It's intended for a single author using the django admin portal.<br>
Additional users can be added by the admin.<br>
Everything is dynamically generated and inserted into django templates.<br>
All the user needs to do is login and write the article in /admin .<br>

#### Project is built on:
Ubuntu 20.04<br>
Python 3.10.4<br>
Django 4.0.3<br>
##### Additional requirements:<br>
pip install pillow <i>(for handling images)</i><br>

## Important note:
I find myself wasting 95% of the time trying to align elements<br>
with CSS and Bootstrap instead of writing actual django code.<br>
The back-end functuonality took less than a day!<br>
So the Contacts and About pages will be left without a front-end.
